            <strong>About Me</strong>
        </div>
        <p>Hi, I am Hardik Gupta.I am 20 Years old & currently a student of  Electronics And Communication Engineering (don't
               know why. Still haven't figured it out) at NIT Hamirpur(beautiful place,by the way).I have many talents (as I
               like to think). I make Memes, Digital Art, Comic Strips and Photography.All of this on my Samsung phone. I edit my
               photos on Snapseed. For making Digital Art and Comic  Strips I use an app whose name I will not disclose (It's a 
               secret) and as for the stylus  I use a  high-precision state of the art  instrument - A polystyrene made hand held 
               body of a ball-point pen wrapped around in a thick layer of conducting Aluminium Wrap (gotcha there.....but #BROKE). 
               And as for making high quality content Memes I observe my habitat with my Eagle Vision and look for oppourtunities.I 
               also watch a lot of Youtube videos to keep my Meme knowledge up-to-date. I post my artworks and photographs on my 
               Instagram so you can check them  there if you want to.
           <br>
           <br>That's enough of what I do and my many  talents.Let's talk about my interests. So, I love to watch Anime - so 
               far I have watched Pokemon, Beyblade, My Hero Academia (my two favourite animes of all time) and One Punch Man...
               (clearly not too many but I'm kicking my anime game up a notch). In sports watch Formula 1, that's it. Once ON, 
               you can't stop me. It basically runs through my mind all day round. So beware when you say F1 in front of me.
           <br>
           <br>I also like to play Football and  Badminton. I also play video games like Assassin's Creed (favourite) and
               Need For Speed. I have a thing for racing games in particular. Give me any and I'll make sure to grind you
               to dust. I've watched TV shows like Friends (obviously), Brooklynn Nine Nine, Goblin, 13 Reasons Why and 
               the list goes on.
           <br>
           <br>That's all about me. I am a hardworking person and I always try to give my best to the thing that I do. 
               I make sure to give my maximum effort to the task. I was able make this website through my hardwork only 
               and I hope you like it.
